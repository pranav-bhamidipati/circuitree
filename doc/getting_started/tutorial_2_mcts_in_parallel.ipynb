    "MCTS is an iterative sampling algorithm, where the reward found in each iteration affects sampling in later iterations. While perfect parallel execution isn't possible, we can achieve quite good performance using the so-called lock-free method [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-12993-3_2), where multiple multiple search threads in the same CPU (the *main node*) are running MCTS concurrently, each one taking turns editing the search graph. We will implement this in detail later in the tutorial, but in brief, instead of computing the (usually expensive) reward function, each search thread on the main node sends a request to a group of worker CPUs (the *worker node*) somewhere else that will do the actual computation, and while that thread is waiting for the result, other search threads can use the main CPU. As long as our execution time is significantly longer than the time spent sending and receiving those signals, we should see a performance boost!"

    "In order to parallelize the search on a local machine, we can nominate a group of CPUs in our own computer to be the worker node that performs reward function evaluations. We can coordinate the main and worker nodes using a *producer-consumer* queue. The main node will produce tasks (calls to the reward function) that get added to the queue, and the worker node will consume tasks from the queue and return the result to a shared database where the main node can look up the result. We'll manage this task queue with the Python utility `celery`. \n",

This means that when the main node calls the function, it dispatches a task to the workers, and the result can be requested later.

This immediately returns an `AsyncResult` object that can be inspected to monitor progress. Then, once we need the result, we call `future.get()` and wait for the reward to arrive. While one thread is waiting for the reply, another thread can take over the main node and run a search iteration. \n",

The communication between main and worker nodes can be a bottleneck in scaling up this infrastructure, so it is important that your database has fast, high-bandwidth networking and is on the same network as the main and worker nodes. Most cloud providers already have a solution for this (for example, as of May 2024, Amazon Elasticache + EC2). The main node has the search graph and makes backups, so it will generally need higher memory, while worker nodes should have higher computing resources. Also, because Celery does not make it obvious where each task is run, you should take care that your backups are being saved to the correct location on the correct machine. Celery generally provides very robust logging as well, so be sure to specify the `--logfile` option in the `celery worker` command to take advantage of it. "
